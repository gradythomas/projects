This class was very hands on and used the ESP32 microcontroller and a class Python server to teach the basics of embedded system design         and the Internet of Things through labs and projects. I really loved this class, and it is probably my favorite class I've taken so far at MIT.         For our final project, we were given 4 weeks in teams of 5 to build something interesting and complex that used both our ESP32 system and a REST API hosted         on the class server. We decided to build a sampler, a musical instrument that can record a sound and then play it back with a keyboard. Unfurtonately we         were sent home due to COVID-19 in March 2020, so the whole of this project was done remotely. This meant all of our collaboration was done over GitHub and Zoom,         and the teaching team shipped us any extra parts we needed, such as the speaker and copper tape."],t=["Capabilities","Our final product was a fairly robust sampling and song creation machine. There was a UI displayed on the ESP LCD screen that was controlled with two buttons.         A user could record a sound through the microphone, where the raw sound data would then be sent to the server to be put through our Python pitch shifting         algorithm that returned the 12 notes of the chromatic scale back down to the ESP, where it was stored in memory. The user could then choose to record a song with         the new sound, and use the capacitive touch keyboard to do so. Each touch triggered a note to be played out of the speaker. Once the song was finished,         it was sent to and stored on the         server in a SQL database. Users could use their browser to click through and listen to various songs and sounds recorded by other users."];return Object(S.jsxs)(S.Fragment,{children:[Object(S.jsx)(H,{header:e[0],paragraph:e[1]}),Object(S.jsx)(A,{src:"/projects/sampler_pic.jpg",width:"504",height:"378",caption:"The final product"}),Object(S.jsx)(H,{header:t[0],paragraph:t[1]}),Object(S.jsx)(A,{src:"/projects/song_ui.png",width:"60%",height:"60%",caption:"Browser UI"})]})}var U=Object(T.a)((function(e){return{videoBox:{display:"flex",justifyContent:"center",paddingTop:10},blogHeader:{marginBottom:10,marginTop:20}}}));function _(){var e=U();return Object(S.jsxs)(S.Fragment,{children:[[["Background","nugs.net is a streaming service for primarily live music and              seems to be built on the AngularJS framework.

Following this URL leads to a blank page where the mp3 file is embedded in a basic              html video player with the audio/mp3 file type.

However, because their file storage site is not secure, it is very easy to download any song stored there.             Obviously that violates their Terms of Service so I have not done so, but I have reached out to nugs.net about the issue. I believe it would be a             relatively easy fix, perhaps by making the file server private, or requiring some sort of authentication from the client before serving the file."]].map((function(e){return Object(S.jsx)(H,{header:e[0],paragraph:e[1]})})),Object(S.jsx)(E,{text:"Demonstration"}),Object(S.jsx)("div",{className:e.videoBox,children:Object(S.jsx)("iframe",{width:"560",height:"315",src:"https://www.youtube.com/embed/q_uS7ZxgQzw",title:"YouTube video player",frameborder:"0",allow:"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture",allowfullscreen:!0})})]})}function N(){return Object(S.jsx)(l.a,{variant:"body1",children:"This page documents the brushless motor I designed and created for 6.A01, or my freshman advising seminar about making at MIT."})}function L(){return Object(S.jsx)(l.a,{variant:"body1",children:"This page shows off the music I have recorded and made as well as documents some of the process."})}var q=Object(T.a)((function(e){return{root:{display:"flex",flexDirection:"column",height:"100%"},title:{flexGrow:1},container:{padding:40,backgroundColor:"#FFFFFF",height:"100%",flexGrow:1}}}));function J(){var e=q(),t=Object(n.useState)(!1),a=Object(s.a)(t,2),o=a[0],r=a[1],i=Object(n.useState)(null),p=Object(s.a)(i,2),f=p[0],x=p[1],y=Object(n.useState)(0),k=Object(s.a)(y,2),T=k[0],C=k[1],E=function(e){C(e.target.value),r(!1)},B={0:"Home",1:"6.08 Sampler Project",2:"nugs.net Web App Exploit",3:"6.A01 Brushless Motor",4:"Recorded Music"};return Object(S.jsxs)("div",{className:e.root,children:[Object(S.jsx)(c.a,{position:"sticky",children:Object(S.jsxs)(d.a,{children:[Object(S.jsx)(h.a,{edge:"start",color:"inherit",onClick:function(e){r(!0),x(e.currentTarget)},children:Object(S.jsx)(g.a,{})}),Object(S.jsx)(l.a,{variant:"h6",className:e.title,children:B[T]}),Object(S.jsx)(u.a,{anchorEl:f,open:o,onClose:function(){return r(!1)},children:Object.keys(B).map((function(e){return Object(S.jsx)(b.a,{value:e,onClick:E,children:B[e]})}))}),Object(S.jsx)(j.a,{title:"LinkedIn",color:"inherit",children:Object(S.jsx)(h.a,{onClick:function(e){window.open("https://www.linkedin.com/in/grady-thomas-7530a71a2","_blank")},children:Object(S.jsx)(I.a,{})})}),Object(S.jsx)(j.a,{title:"GitHub",color:"inherit",children:Object(S.jsx)(h.a,{onClick:function(e){window.open("https://github.com/gradythomas","_blank")},children:Object(S.jsx)(O.a,{})})}),Object(S.jsx)(j.a,{title:"Resume",color:"inherit",children:Object(S.jsx)(h.a,{onClick:function(e){window.open("/projects/ResumePDF.pdf","_blank")},children:Object(S.jsx)(w.a,{})})}),Object(S.jsx)(j.a,{title:"Spotify",color:"inherit",children:Object(S.jsx)(h.a,{onClick:function(e){window.open("https://open.spotify.com/artist/6TkfOksTZM6tfOU8knP0gd?si=caVUG_9wR0utpYd2MEan6A","_blank")},children:Object(S.jsx)(v.a,{})})})]})}),Object(S.jsxs)(m.a,{className:e.container,maxWidth:"md",children:[0==T&&Object(S.jsx)(M,{}),1==T&&Object(S.jsx)(G,{}),2==T&&Object(S.jsx)(_,{}),3==T&&Object(S.jsx)(N,{}),4==T&&Object(S.jsx)(L,{})]})]})}var V=a(114),W=a(46),Z=a(61),z=Object(Z.a)({palette:{primary:{main:"#086788"},secondary:{main:"#19857b"},error:{main:W.a.A400},background:{default:"#0E0E52"}}});function Q(){return Object(S.jsxs)(V.a,{theme:z,children:[Object(S.jsx)(i.a,{}),Object(S.jsx)(J,{})]})}r.a.render(Object(S.jsx)(Q,{}),document.querySelector("#root"))}},[[81,1,2]]]);
